	<h2>Motivation</h2>
	<h2>What is the MVP Award?</h2>
	<p>Major league baseball presents the Most Valuable Player award for each league (AL,NL) at the end of each season.  
	Of the 4 major professional sports in America, Baseball is the one whoâ€™s story is most frequently told by statistics.  
	However, even with that being the case, writers for each team are tasked with voting for the MVP based on the following 
	vague set of rules:
	</p>
	<p>There is no clear-cut definition of what Most Valuable means. It is up to the individual voter to decide who was the 
	Most Valuable Player in each league to his team. The MVP need not come from a division winner or other playoff qualifier.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Actual value of a player to his team, that is, strength of offense and defense.</li>
		<li>Number of games played.</li>
		<li>General character, disposition, loyalty and effort.</li>
		<li>Former winners are eligible.</li>
		<li>Members of the committee may vote for more than one member of a team.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You are also urged to give serious consideration to all your selections, from 1 to 10. A 10th-place vote can influence 
	the outcome of an election. You must fill in all 10 places on your ballot. Only regular-season performances are to be 
	taken into consideration.
